### Encrypted Messaging Apps
<br />Well secretive messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram and Wire might not solve Net Neutrality problems, but they can definitely help dodge surveillance and censorship to some extent.
But they all rely on internet and centralized servers and can be easily blocked. See <a href='https://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/mobile/whatsapp-messenger-goes-down-temporarily-in-india-other-countries/61502284'>WhatsApp messenger goes down temporarily in India & other countries</a>

### Long term solution, providing internet directly from satellites
<br />SpaceX's proposal to launch hundreds of internet service satellites is backed by FCC chairman now. The company plans to launch 800 satellites worldwide to provide high speed internet to people all around the global. 
See <a href='http://money.cnn.com/2018/02/14/technology/spacex-internet-satellites-fcc/index.html'>FCC chairman backs SpaceX plan for internet satellites</a> 

<a href='https://edition.cnn.com/2015/10/30/tech/pioneers-google-facebook-spacex-oneweb-satellite-drone-balloon-internet/index.html?iid=EL'>Other tech giants also have plans to deliver internet services directly to their users using satellites, drones and balloons.</a> 

These all sound great, except they are all expensive and it takes time to implement.

### Short term solution with low cost
<br />Using Short-Range Wireless Communication technologies we can connect every nearby mobile devices directly, bypassing cell phone towers between them, that way internet service providers will not even be aware of the data exchange between mobile devices let alone monitor, filter or block the content.

There are 2 popular Short-Range Wireless communication technologies among smart phones. Wifi Direct aka Wifi P2P is fully supported by Android devices. Blebooth Low Energy (BLE) is well supported by iOS devices. BLE central role supported was included in Android 4.3 and BLE peripheral role got supported in Android 5.0 so BLE can be used to connect iOS devices with modern Android devices. (Mobile phone manufacturers can choose not support BLE peripheral role for Android 5.0+, though)

<strong>For the social media giants who are struggling to enter China's market, finally there may be a hope. If I were the decision makers of the big names, I'd create some APPs dedicated to China, using BLE + WifiDirect to connect nearby users directly without having any servers to fully compliant with China's new cybersecurity law, which requires certain companies to store personal and "significant data" on servers in China. Because you don't have to collect user information and store it to a server. (Users will store their profiles locally and exchange profiles directly with each other using Short-Range Wireless Communication technologies :))</strong>

Short transmission range and low data rate are the 2 disadvantages of Wifi Direct and Bluetooth Low Energy though.
